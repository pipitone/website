Over the next two weeks (May 17 - May 26), I and a group of other staff, 
students, trainees, from the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH) in 
Toronto are putting on [a series of computing workshops for our 
researchers](http://camh-scwg.github.io/compucool). CAMH is Toronto's mental 
health hospital and research centre. 

These workshops heavily Software Carpentry-inspired -- for some of them, we are 
directly using the Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry materials, and 
handful of instructors are Software Carpentry certified. 

We are covering the shell, R, python, MATLAB, SPSS, MS Access, web design, 
using the CAMH compute cluster, photoshop and others. All topics that were 
picked by CAMH researchers; we have a small [working group](https://camh-swcg.github.io)
of mostly computing-savvy researchers from across the hospital that have 
their fingers on the pulse of what's needed.

What's interesting to me is that this is a very collaborative effo
